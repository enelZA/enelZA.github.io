# This and the following lines beginning with '#' are the blog post header.
# Please take your time and replace these options with desired values. Just
# remember that the date has to be in the YYYY-MM-DD form, tags are a comma
# separated list of categories the post (pages ignore these) belong to, and
# the url,  if provided, should consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens
# and underscores only.  Specifying your own url  is especially recommended
# in case you use non-ASCII characters in your blog post title.

Install the excellent html-xml-utils utility via apt-get

	sudo apt-get install html-xml-utils

Use curl in conjunction with hxnormalize and hxselect to parse the Google meta tags from the Google finance web page.

In this example the code will connect to Google finance and query the stock price for Apple computers.

    curl -s https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL 
    | hxnormalize -l 240 -x 2>/dev/null 
    | hxselect -s '\n' 'meta[itemprop="price"] ' 
    | awk -F'[="]' '{print $3}'

The above script should be run as a one liner.
