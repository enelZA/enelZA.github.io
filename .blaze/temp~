This tutorial will demonstrate how to setup a static blog using [BlazeBlogger](http://blaze.blackened.cz) as the blog template engine.

###Prerequisites and assumptions

1. This tutorial make use of the apt-get package manager on Debian based Linux distros, please substitute with your favourite package installer.
2. In order to keep things simple, I've used nano as the default text editor in this tutorial 

### Install BlazeBlogger

From your Linux command line, execute the following command

	sudo apt-get install blazeblogger

### Create and configure your blog

Create a new folder that will contain your blog html files. For this example I will create a folder called *mynewblog* in my Home folder.

	mkdir ~/mynewblog 

Make sure you are in the newly created folder.

	cd ~/mynewblog

The next step is to initialize a new blog container by typing the following command in your blog folder.

	blaze-init

This will create a hidden folder called **.blaze**. This folder contains the configuration settings for your blog.
Edit and change the configuration file. 

	nano ~/mynewblog/.blaze/config

Change the title, subtitle description and keywords settings to match your blog.

Press the Control and o key and then Enter to save the config file. 
Press Control and x to exit.

### Create your first blog entry

BlazeBlogger ships with a command called blaze-add, enter the command and create your first blog entry, press Control and x to save and exit the nano text editor.

The blaze-make command will create your website and add the blog entry. It will create your landing page called "index.html". 

Here is the output of index.html.
