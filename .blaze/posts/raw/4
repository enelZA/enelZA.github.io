Scheduled cron jobs can be hard to get right especially if the the cron job calls another script. 
The scheduled script should no output anything to standard out and the script is triggered by a new instance of  /bin/sh

In order to test your scheduled script in the same way as cron will run it, issue the following command.

      /bin/sh -c "(
      export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin;
      /home/user/cron/scriptname.sh
       </dev/null)"

It simulates a cron execution of the scriptname.sh script.
